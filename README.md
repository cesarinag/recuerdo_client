# haiku75.
welcome to haiku75. a place where you can write haikus with a _challenge_. if you're already a fan of the short poetry type - you'll especially love the challenge of only getting 75 total max characters to compose a haiku - and yes, that includes the title too. enjoy ðŸ˜ˆ.

### Planning Process and Problem-Solving Strategy
Originally, my capstone project was going to be an Instagram clone. I created wireframes (shown below) for an Instagram clone that was to be called 'recuerdo', hence the name of the project and repositories. I quickly became uninterested in an Instagram clone and felt like a Twitter clone was far more my cup of tea. But I lost interest for that as well. I write poetry and have for many years (shameless upcoming book plug here) and I felt much more inclined to create something that resonated with my interests. I love Twitter - but I felt more inclined towards this niche. The real issue was figuring out how many characters were enough characters to still be a challenge but I'll delve more into that on my backend repo.
